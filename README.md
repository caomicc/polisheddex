# PolishedDex

Pokémon Polished Crystal Database

## Overview
PolishedDex is a modern, searchable Pokédex and location guide for Pokémon Polished Crystal. It provides detailed stats, moves, evolutions, locations, and more for every Pokémon in the game, with a clean, accessible UI and fast navigation.

I have written most of this project with Claude Sonnet 4, Copilot and the help of my [lovely husband](https://github.com/NickAkhmetov)


## Features
- Browse all Pokémon with stats, types, evolutions, moves, and locations
- Explore all game locations and see which Pokémon are available in each area
- Hidden Grotto and special encounter support
- Accessible, responsive design with dark mode
- Fast search and navigation
- Data sourced from game files and scripts
- Modern Next.js App Router architecture

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (utility-first styling)
- **shadcn/ui** and **Radix UI** (accessible components)

## Project Structure

### `/src/utils/extractors`
This folder contains utility functions for extracting data from the Pokémon Polished Crystal ROM files. Each file focuses on a specific type of data extraction.

#### `tmHmExtractors.ts`
- Extracts TM/HM item data from ROM files.
- Merges extracted data with existing `items_data.json`.
- Handles faithful and polished versions of moves.

#### `statsExtractors.ts`
- Extracts detailed stats for Pokémon, including abilities, moves, and forms.
- Differentiates between faithful and polished versions of abilities and moves.

#### `pokedexExtractors.ts`
- Updates Pokémon JSON files with dex entries.
- Normalizes Pokémon names for consistent file naming.

#### `moveExtractors.ts`
- Extracts move descriptions, stats, and names from ROM files.
- Parses faithful and polished versions of moves.

### `/src/types`
Contains TypeScript interfaces and types for the project.

#### `types.ts`
- Defines types for Pokémon stats, moves, abilities, locations, and more.
- Includes support for faithful and polished versions of data.

### `/output`
This folder contains JSON files generated by the extraction scripts. These files are used by the Next.js app to display data.

#### Key Files:
- `items_data.json`: Contains item data, including TM/HM information.
- `pokemon_base_data.json`: Basic Pokémon data, including dex numbers and types.

- Supports faithful and polished versions of data.

### `/extract_locations.ts`
- Extracts location data, including NPC trades, events, items, and TM/HM locations.
- Consolidates duplicate location entries and normalizes keys.
- Generates comprehensive location files for use in the app.

### `/docs`
Contains documentation for the project.

#### Key Files:
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Detailed coding standards and guidelines for the project.


## Extraction Process
Run the extraction scripts using the following commands:
- `npm run extract`: Extracts all data and generates JSON files in the `/output` directory.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow coding standards outlined in `copilot-instructions.md`.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and clear definitions.
- Write unit tests for all functions and utilities.
- Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages.
