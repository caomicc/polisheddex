# Location Extraction Enhancement - Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

The location extraction has been enhanced to include **all map locations** with their connections and flyable status.

## 📊 Final Results

- **169 total locations** extracted
- **144 landmark locations** with world map coordinates  
- **25 map-only locations** (no world map coordinates but still accessible)
- **208 total map connections** between locations
- **32 flyable locations** identified

## 🗂️ Location Categories

### Landmark Locations (144)
- Have world map coordinates (x, y)
- Visible on the world map
- Include cities, towns, routes, caves, etc.
- Example: Route 9 connects west to Cerulean City and east to Route 10 North

### Map-Only Locations (25)
- No world map coordinates (x: -1, y: -1)
- Not visible on world map but accessible through connections
- Example: Magnet Tunnel East connects north to Ruins of Alph Outside and east to Route 32

## 🔗 Connection System

Each location includes:
- **Direction**: north, south, east, west
- **Target Location**: the connected location's key
- **Display Name**: human-readable name for the target
- **Offset**: positioning offset for the connection

## 🛠️ Technical Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Regex Patterns**: Updated constant matching to include numbers (Route_9, Route_10_North, etc.)
   - `[A-Z_]+` → `[A-Z_0-9_]+`

2. **Enhanced Map Parsing**: Now correctly parses all map attributes and their connections

3. **Bidirectional Connections**: All connections are properly represented in both directions

## 📁 Output Files

- `output/all_locations.json` - Complete location data sorted by region
- `output/locations_by_region.json` - Summary statistics and locations grouped by region

## 🧪 Verification

Route 9 example (previously had empty connections, now working correctly):
```json
{
  "id": 89,
  "name": "route_9", 
  "displayName": "Route 9",
  "region": "kanto",
  "x": 124,
  "y": 44,
  "flyable": false,
  "connections": [
    {
      "direction": "west",
      "targetLocation": "cerulean_city", 
      "targetLocationDisplay": "Cerulean City",
      "offset": -4
    },
    {
      "direction": "east",
      "targetLocation": "route_10_north",
      "targetLocationDisplay": "Route 10 North", 
      "offset": -6
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The extraction system is now comprehensive and can be integrated into the main application. All files in `src/utils/extractors/locationExtractors.ts` have been updated with the fixes and are ready for use.
