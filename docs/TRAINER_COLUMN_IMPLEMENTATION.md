# Trainer Column and Filter Implementation

## Summary
Successfully added a "Has Trainers" column and filter to the location listing page, allowing users to view and filter locations based on trainer presence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Location Data Processing (`/src/app/locations/page.tsx`)

#### Added Trainer Properties to EnhancedLocation Interface:
- `hasTrainers: boolean` - Whether location has any trainers
- `trainerCount: number` - Number of trainers in location

#### Updated Data Loading Functions:
- Modified `loadAllLocationData()` to extract trainer data from location JSON
- Added trainer checks: `Boolean(location.trainers && location.trainers.length > 0)`
- Added trainer counts: `location.trainers ? location.trainers.length : 0`
- Ensured pokemon-only locations have `hasTrainers: false` and `trainerCount: 0`

#### Enhanced Overview Statistics:
- Updated stats grid from 4 to 5 columns
- Added "With Trainers" stat showing count of locations with trainers
- Used red color scheme for trainer statistics to match trainer UI theme

### 2. Updated Table Columns (`/src/components/pokemon/location-columns.tsx`)

#### Enhanced LocationData Interface:
- Added `hasTrainers?: boolean`
- Added `trainerCount?: number`

#### New Trainers Column:
- Added sortable "Trainers" column showing trainer count
- Positioned after Pokemon column for logical flow
- Shows trainer count or "-" if none
- Includes proper sorting functionality with up/down arrows
- Center-aligned for consistency

### 3. Enhanced Data Table (`/src/components/pokemon/location-data-table.tsx`)

#### New Filter State:
- Added `showOnlyTrainers` state for trainer filtering
- Integrated into existing checkbox filter system

#### Updated Filter Logic:
- Enhanced `filteredData` to include trainer filtering
- Added `matchesTrainers` condition to filter criteria

#### New Sort Options:
- Added "Most Trainers First" and "Least Trainers First" options
- Updated sort handling to support `trainerCount` column
- Enhanced sort value detection for trainer-based sorting

#### Enhanced UI:
- Added "Has trainers" checkbox filter
- Positioned logically between Pokemon and Flyable filters
- Updated filter summary text to include trainer filtering
- Enhanced clear filters functionality to reset trainer filter

#### Responsive Layout:
- Adjusted column widths to accommodate new trainer column
- Location name: 35% (reduced from 40%)
- Trainer count: 12% (same as Pokemon count)
- Maintained visual consistency across all columns
